My fastest prime calculator yet, entirely written in c.
<h1>Usage:</h1>
<h2>Linux</h2>
make<p>
(Then after that you can use ./a.out (some number) to get all primes up to (some number))
<h2>Everything else</h2>
Same as linux, just if you don't have make installed on your machine you can replace make by the stuff in the Makefile.<p>
Also make sure you have gcc.
